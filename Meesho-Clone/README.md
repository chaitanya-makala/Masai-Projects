<h3>Journey</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Our task was to clone Meesho website(www.meesho.com). This is our first time
    working in a team and handling a project. We used our knowledge in HTML, CSS
    and JavaScript which we learned at Masai to handle the project.
  </li>
  <li>
    We started this project with a zoom meet and discussed about our skill level
    in HTML, JS and CSS. Then, we’ve divided the website into parts and each one
    of us was allocated with one particular feature of the website. We then
    discussed about the means of communication and other things. As this was our
    first time meeting each other and our first time organizing a meet. The
    first meet went a little confusing and disoriented.
  </li>
  <li>
    We mainly used WhatsApp for communication as it was easier to use than
    Slack. We had zoom meets everyday to discuss our progress and to clarify any
    doubts that we had about the project or the issues that we’ve encountered
    while doing our part in the project.
  </li>
  <li>
    We’ve finished the HTML layout part first and then proceeded with the
    Styling(CSS) section. We have added the functionality(JS) part to the
    website at the end of our project.
  </li>
  <li>
    It was a good experience working with a team. Each of us tried to help the
    others when we encountered issues. We faced a lot of challenges while doing
    the project.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We faced issues pulling and pushing code and using Git.</li>
  <li>
    We faced issues while adding functionality to the website as adding
    JavaScript to the site was pretty new to us.
  </li>
  <li>
    We faced issue with giving unique ID’s and Classes to the HTML code in the
    initial days.
  </li>
  <li>We faced co-ordination issues among us in the beginning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  We would like to conclude our views with the following note. It was a
  refreshing and unique experience working with a team and taking ownership and
  organizing meets and dividing work among us. We’ve had a great feeling after
  finishing the project and merging all of our code. All of us are from
  different geographical and ethnical backgrounds and we’ve had some fun working
  together. We are looking forward to working together once again and also to
  meet new people throughout our journey in Masai.
